This is the README for chrony, but in rust.

What is chrony?
===============

chrony is a versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
It can synchronise the system clock with NTP servers, reference clocks
(e.g. GPS receiver), and manual input using wristwatch and keyboard.
It can also operate as an NTPv4 (RFC 5905) server and peer to provide
a time service to other computers in the network.

It is designed to perform well in a wide range of conditions, including
intermittent network connections, heavily congested networks, changing
temperatures (ordinary computer clocks are sensitive to temperature),
and systems that do not run continuosly, or run on a virtual machine.

Typical accuracy between two machines synchronised over the Internet is
within a few milliseconds; on a LAN, accuracy is typically in tens of
microseconds.  With hardware timestamping, or a hardware reference clock,
sub-microsecond accuracy may be possible.

Two programs are included in chrony, chronyd is a daemon that can be
started at boot time and chronyc is a command-line interface program
which can be used to monitor chronyd's performance and to change various
operating parameters whilst it is running.

Where's the original program's site?

Should I use this?
==================

No, not yet. This is still a toy project.
